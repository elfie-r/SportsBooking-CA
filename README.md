# SportsBooking-CA
WinForms project using Entity Framework for an imaginary Sports Facility Management System

Two use cases -
1) To allow members to make a booking at any facility
2) To check on the availability of facilities

Remaining use cases coded by my teammates were not included.

### Getting started

SA46Team08ADatabase.bak is the test database built for the application. 

1. Load the database.

2. Run SA46Team08ASportsFacilityBooking.sln using Visual Studio.
